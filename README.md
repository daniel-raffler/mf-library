# mf-library

Abstract machine for a lazy functional language. This library defines the bytecode for the machine and provides functions to read and write executable files that have been created by the compiler

All work based on the paper "Übersetzerbau – Abstrakte Maschinen" by François Bry and Norbert Eisinger
